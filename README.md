#Festival Memory Wall

A multilingual, AI-powered, open-source Streamlit app to preserve India’s diverse festival traditions through community-contributed images and descriptions.

## Project Description

**Festival Memory Wall** allows users to upload photos from Indian festivals and describe them in their native language. This creates a visual and linguistic memory wall that captures India's rich cultural heritage — one festival at a time.

The project is part of a 4-week internship sprint focused on building offline-first, accessible, and open-source applications that contribute to the creation of culturally rich datasets.
