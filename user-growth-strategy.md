## 🎯 1. Target Audience & Outreach Channels

### Target Users

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| WhatsApp Groups            | Share app + call for contributions locally |
| Instagram & Facebook       | Reach younger audiences visually           |

| Swecha/viswam.ai Networks  | Tech + cultural enthusiast user base       |
| College Cultural Clubs     | Tie-in during cultural events or holidays  |
| Word of Mouth              | Encourage existing users to share          |

## 💡 2. Messaging Strategy

### Value Proposition
> “Preserve your festival memories. Your story, your photo, your language — immortalized forever.”

### Sample Outreach Messages

- “Do you have a photo from Holi, Pongal, or Eid? Upload it with a short story in your own language. Help build India’s cultural memory wall.”
- “Let’s document our traditions together. Add a photo and caption from your favorite festival — in any Indian language.”
- “No signup needed. Just upload, describe, and share. Let your culture shine.”

### Media Assets

- 3 festival posters with QR code
- Demo meme showing app usage
- WhatsApp status-ready banner
- Hindi/Telugu memes explaining the idea

## 🛠️ 3. Execution Plan

### Week 3 (Soft Launch)
- Launch app with MVP features live
- Share in 5–10 WhatsApp groups
- Post on Instagram with 1–2 reels
- Add QR posters in our college/classroom
- Ask team members to contribute 2 entries each

### Week 4 (Campaign Push)
- Run a mini contest: “Top 3 memories win a shoutout or swag”
- Post 3 community-submitted entries on Instagram
- Pitch to local media or cultural influencers
- Translate flyer into 3 regional languages

## 📊 4. Results & Metrics

| Metric                    | Value                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Total Users Reached       | 300+ via WhatsApp & IG     |
| Submissions Collected     | 50 festival memories       |
| Unique Languages Covered  | 6+ (Telugu, Tamil, Hindi…) |

## 🙌 5. Key Learnings

- Users liked the simplicity of uploading without login.
- Many preferred contributing in English due to keyboard issues.
- Visual memes and regional WhatsApp groups worked better than Instagram alone.
- Next iteration should support voice input or transliteration.


## ✨ Next Steps

- Add "Share Your Story" WhatsApp bot
- Integrate feedback form on submission
- Partner with folk festival organizers for dataset scale-up
